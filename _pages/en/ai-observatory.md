The Italian Observatory on Artificial Intelligence is an initiative of the **AI
Task Force** in cooperation with the research institute **HER - Human Ecosystem
Relations**.

Using the most advanced technologies, such as NLP (Natural Language
Processing), Machine Learning, Sentiment and Emotional Analysis, the Observatory
collects and analyse public conversations about artificial intelligence on
social networks in Italy so to capture the sentiment about AI in the country.

Who talks about artificial intelligence in Italy? How and  how often does it
happen? How do they feel about it? Collected data are made available as an open
data set to citizens, businesses, researchers, students, schools and
associations.

In this way the Observatory contributes to the national and international debate
on artificial intelligence by providing easily accessible data that are useful
to understand the phenomenon, in line with the open data principles.
